### Gigabyte Extreme Gaming Engine
A useful gigabyte software control software and easy to use.

### ShadowSocks
very useful software VPN. https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-windows

### Clash for Windows
A similar VPN software. https://github.com/Dreamacro/clash

### UCR
A powerful keyboard self-design software. For example, it could simply modigy single keyboard keys without influence other keyboard and do not need to modify the register in windows. It is much similar to MacOS karabiner-elements.
For me, I exchange the left-ctrl and caps lock, left alt and left windwos. In addition, there is a AutoHotKey script allow me to start the UCR setting scripts in the back-end which do not influence the appearance of the explorer.exe showing the wallpaper. I will attatch the script to the windows folders and teach you how to use it.
If somebody have the ability to automatically hide the TIM QQ and YY to the background, please contact me. THx very much!
